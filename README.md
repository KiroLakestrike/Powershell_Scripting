# Powershell Scripts and learning

This repo is just for myself, and to maybe show off my process of learning powershell. Using a course on Udemy. 

I started on August 20th 2025. 

Goal is to be finished by September 16th, as its the last day of my Sick leave.

The scripts are a little disorganized, I might attempt to Sort them into Folders by Chapter or such. But as said, this here is wholly just for me, to keep a list of all the scripts i wrote, and talk to friends about them.
